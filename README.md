`Mnd` is a simple library for programming with monads.
It aims to be comprehensible instead of comprehensive.
Everything is standard and already exists in various places, this is simply a selection for easy re-use.
The code is in [a single file](lib/mnd.ml) and has no dependencies.

The documentation is available [online](https://maurobringolf.ch/mnd).
